# Umbrastic

This library is an adaptation of the excellent [Umbraco.Elasticsearch](https://github.com/Philo/Umbraco.Elasticsearch). It has been adapted to our specific use case on Elasticsearch v5.3.2.

If you are looking to integrate Umbraco with Elasticsearch we recommend using Umbraco.Elasticsearch in the first instance.
